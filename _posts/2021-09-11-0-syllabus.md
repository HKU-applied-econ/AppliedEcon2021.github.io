Course website: A Moodle course on the HKU portal. Students are encouraged to visit the course website at least once a week.


To get started with this course, we need to set up the environment for data analysis on your PC/Mac.
We mainly use two languages for this course, R and Python. You can pick one favorate language to use.


## Course Description

This course studies how practical problems can be solved by applying econometric methods.
The emphasis is on the application of econometric methods to the analysis of real world economic data using advanced statistical software.
Topics include multilinear regressions, limited dependent variable, panel data, experiments and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, time series and forecasting, and basics of machine learning.

Pre-requisites:
 - Solid knowledge of statistics
 - Introductory level econometric methods
 - Linear algebra

Students are encouraged to check out student resources the publisher provides on the Internet. Lecture slides will be posted on the course website. Additional handouts will be distributed when needed to supplement the textbook.



## **Course Objectives**



1. To provide knowledge of econometric methods for analysis of economic data
2. To provide hands-on experiences of data analysis using statistical software

## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students are expected to:

CLO1. Be familiar with the basics of statistics and econometrics.    
CLO2. Be able to build an econometric model for a problem and choose an appropriate econometric method to estimate the model.   
CLO3. Be able to do estimation and hypothesis testing of the econometric model using statistical software.   
CLO4. Be able to interpret results


### **Alignment of Program and Course Outcomes**



| **Program Learning Outcomes**                                | **Alignment** **with CLOs** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| PLO1. Understanding  of fundamental theories and new development in economics | CLO1                        |
| PLO2. Mastering of skills  in analyzing economic data        | CLO1 and CLO2               |
| PLO3. Demonstration  of ability to apply economic knowledge and analytical skills to address  policy and business problems | CLO3                        |

### **Teaching and Learning Activities**

 1. Lectures:     Instructors give lectures on major concepts and issues.
 2. Consultation:     The instructors and tutors hold weekly consultation hours.
 3. Weekly TA section will start from the second week. The tutor will go over problem sets and discuss more exercises during the in-class sessions, while in some sessions the tutor will show students how to use the statistical software – R/Python to do the analysis.
 4. Homework:  Students are required to solve problems and do exercises to internalize basic     concepts and carry out econometric analysis of economic data using statistical     software.

### **Assessment Tasks/Evaluation Plan**

Homework: 30 %  
Midterm Exam: 30 %  
Final Exam: 40 %  





This course will include the following types of assessment

Homework:

There will be 6 homework assignments. These will be posted on the course website along with due dates. You can work in groups (of up to three) but we strongly encourage you to work through the problems independently before working together as a group. No late assignments will be accepted nor will any credit be given for turning in assignments after the due date. Assignments will reinforce key concepts and provide hands-on experiences with empirical applications. They will also serve as preparation for exams.



 The final exam is to be scheduled by the exam unit of the University.


### **Academic Conduct**



The University regulations on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. Also, please check the University Statement on plagiarism at [http://www.hku.hk/plagiarism/](http://www.hku.hk/plagiarism/)

### STATA(For your own interest)
Since the course is intended to give students hands-on experiences of data analysis, it is very important for students to learn and get familiar with statistical software. The main software program for the course is STATA, which is available on computers at the school’s computer labs, KKL 1009 and KKL 1102. STATA is also available on a school server. Details for server access will be provided later on.



Many online resources are available to help students learn STATA. Students can visit the official website of STATA at http://www.stata.com/links/resources1.html. Tutorials on some university websites, such as http://data.princeton.edu/stata/, are also very useful.
