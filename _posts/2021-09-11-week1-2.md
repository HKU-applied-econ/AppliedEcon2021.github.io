After we configure the environment, we start with basic dataset. For this section, we show the basic data analysis using the dataset.

# Python Basics
In this section, we get familiar with the syntax of Python, commenting, conditional
statements, loops, and functions.
## Comments
A comment explains what a line of code does, and is used by programmers to help others understand the code they have written. In Python, a comment starts with the # symbol.
## Printing
The print function prints content to the screen or any other output device.
Generally, we pass a combination of strings and variables as arguments to the print
function. Arguments are the values included within the parenthesis of a function, which
the function uses for producing the result. In the following statement, “Hello!” is the
argument to the print function.

``` python
print('''Today is a lovely day.
It will be warm and sunny.
It is ideal for hiking.''')
```

Output:

    Today is a lovely day.
    It will be warm and sunny.
    It is ideal for hiking.

Note that we do not use semicolons in Python to end statements, unlike some other languages.
The format method can be used in conjunction with the print method for embedding
variables within a string. It uses curly braces as placeholders for variables that are passed
as arguments to the method.
