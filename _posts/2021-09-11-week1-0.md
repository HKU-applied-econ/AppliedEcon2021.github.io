To get started with this course, we need to set up the environment for data analysis on your PC/Mac.
We mainly use two languages for this course, R and Python. You can pick one favorate language to use. 


## Course Description

This course studies how practical problems can be solved by applying econometric methods. 
The emphasis is on the application of econometric methods to the analysis of real world economic data using advanced statistical software. 
Topics include multilinear regressions, limited dependent variable, panel data, experiments and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, time series and forecasting, and basics of machine learning.

Pre-requisites: 
 - Solid knowledge of statistics
 - Introductory level econometric methods 
 - Linear algebra
