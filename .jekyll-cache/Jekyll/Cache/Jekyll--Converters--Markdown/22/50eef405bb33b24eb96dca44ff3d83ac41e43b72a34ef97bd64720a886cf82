<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we’ve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
  <li>It’s sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on “program evaluation” in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="correlation-with-causality">Correlation with causality</h4>

<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say “correlation does not mean causality.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn’t cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer’s cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</li>
  <li>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a central bank reading tea leaves to discern when a recessionary wave is forming.</li>
      <li>Seeing evidence that a recession is emerging, the bank enters into open-market operations, buying bonds and pumping liquidity into the economy.</li>
      <li>These actions are done optimally, these open-market operations will show no relationship whatsoever with actual output.</li>
      <li>In fact, in the ideal, banks may engage in aggressive trading in order to stop a recession, and we would be unable to see any evidence that it was working <em>even though it was</em>!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>One of the cornerstones of scientific methodologies is empirical analysis - use data to test a theory or to estimate a relationship between variables.</li>
  <li>The first step in conducting an empirical economic analysis is the careful formulation of the question we would like to answer.</li>
  <li>In some cases, we would like to develop and test a formal economic model that describes mathematically a certain relationship, behavior, or process of interest.
    <ul>
      <li>describe the phenomena of interest and make falsifiable (testable) predictions. A prediction is falsifiable insofar as we can evaluate, and potentially reject, the prediction with data.6 A model is the framework with which we describe the relationships we are interested in, the intuition for our results, and the hypotheses we would like to test.7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After we have specified a model, we turn it into what is called an econometric model, which can be estimated directly with data. One clear issue we immediately face is regarding the functional form of the model, or how to describe the relationships of the variables we are interested in through an equation. Another important issue is how we will deal with variables that cannot be directly or reasonably observed by the researcher, or that cannot be measured very well, but which play an important role in our model.</p>

<p>A generically important contribution to our understanding of causal inference is the notion of comparative statics. Comparative statics are theoretical descriptions of causal effects contained within the model. These kinds of comparative statics are always based on the idea of <em>ceteris paribus</em>—or “all else constant.” When we are trying to describe the causal effect of some intervention, for instance, we are always assuming that the other relevant variables in the model are not changing. If they were changing, then they would be correlated with the variable of interest and it would confound our estimation.8</p>

<p>To illustrate this idea, let’s begin with a basic economic model: supply and demand equilibrium and the problems it creates for estimating the price elasticity of demand. Policy-makers and business managers have a natural interest in learning the price elasticity of demand because knowing it enables firms to maximize profits and governments to choose optimal taxes, and whether to restrict quantity altogether (Becker, Grossman, and Murphy <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com/references.html#ref-Becker2006">2006</a>). But the problem is that we do not observe demand curves, because demand curves are theoretical objects. More specifically, a demand curve is a collection of paired potential outcomes of price and quantity. We observe <em>price and quantity equilibrium values</em>, not the potential price and potential quantities along the entire demand curve. Only by tracing out the potential outcomes along a demand curve can we calculate the elasticity.</p>
