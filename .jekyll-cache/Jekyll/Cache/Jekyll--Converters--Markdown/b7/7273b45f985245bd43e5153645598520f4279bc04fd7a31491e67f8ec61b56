<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we‚Äôve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on ‚Äúprogram evaluation‚Äù in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments.</li>

<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say ‚Äúcorrelation does not mean causality.‚Äù</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn‚Äôt cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer‚Äôs cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</li>
  <li>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>. Now that is definitely strange. How can one thing cause another thing without any discernible correlation between the two things?
