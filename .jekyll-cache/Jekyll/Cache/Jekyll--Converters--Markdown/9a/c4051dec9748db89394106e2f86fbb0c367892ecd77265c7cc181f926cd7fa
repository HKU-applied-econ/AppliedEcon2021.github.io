<p>I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality. I had been orbiting that theory ever since seeing that difference-in-differences table in Levine (2004). But I needed more. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new—I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-would-i-define-causal-inference">So how would I define causal inference?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we’ve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
  <li>It’s sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on “program evaluation” in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="correlation-with-causality">Correlation with causality</h3>

<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say “correlation does not mean causality.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn’t cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer’s cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</li>
  <li>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>. Now that is definitely strange. How can one thing cause another thing without any discernible correlation between the two things?</li>
</ul>
