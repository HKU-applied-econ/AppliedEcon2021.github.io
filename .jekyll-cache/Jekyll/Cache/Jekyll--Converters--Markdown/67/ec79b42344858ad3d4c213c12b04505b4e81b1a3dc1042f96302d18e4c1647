<p>To get started with this course, we need to set up the environment for data analysis on your PC/Mac.
We mainly use two languages for this course, R and Python. You can pick one favorate language to use.</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This course studies how practical problems can be solved by applying econometric methods.
The emphasis is on the application of econometric methods to the analysis of real world economic data using advanced statistical software.
Topics include multilinear regressions, limited dependent variable, panel data, experiments and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, time series and forecasting, and basics of machine learning.</p>

<p>Pre-requisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solid knowledge of statistics</li>

<p>This course will include the following types of assessment</p>

<p>Homework:</p>

<p>There will be 6 homework assignments. These will be posted on the course website along with due dates. You can work in groups (of up to three) but we strongly encourage you to work through the problems independently before working together as a group. No late assignments will be accepted nor will any credit be given for turning in assignments after the due date. Assignments will reinforce key concepts and provide hands-on experiences with empirical applications. They will also serve as preparation for exams.</p>

<p>The final exam is to be scheduled by the exam unit of the University.</p>

<p>Since the course is intended to give students hands-on experiences of data analysis, it is very important for students to learn and get familiar with statistical software. The main software program for the course is STATA, which is available on computers at the school’s computer labs, KKL 1009 and KKL 1102. STATA is also available on a school server. Details for server access will be provided later on.</p>

<p>Many online resources are available to help students learn STATA. Students can visit the official website of STATA at http://www.stata.com/links/resources1.html. Tutorials on some university websites, such as http://data.princeton.edu/stata/, are also very useful.</p>
