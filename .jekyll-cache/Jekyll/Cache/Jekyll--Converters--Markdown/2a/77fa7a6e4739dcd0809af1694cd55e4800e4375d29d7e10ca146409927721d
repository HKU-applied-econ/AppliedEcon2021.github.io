<p>This course studies how practical problems can be solved by applying econometric methods. The emphasis is on the application of econometric methods to the analysis of real world economic data using advanced statistical software. Topics include multilinear regressions, limited dependent variable, panel data, experiments and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, time series and forecasting, and basics of machine learning.</p>

<p>Pre-requisites: Students are expected to have solid knowledge of statistical and econometric methods at the introductory level. If you are not confident with your background, please discuss with the instructors.</p>

<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>

<p>Main textbook: Stock, James and Mark Watson (2018), Introduction to Econometrics, Global Edition, 4th ed., Pearson.</p>

<p>Supplementary textbook: Jeffrey Wooldridge , Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, Ohio : South-Western Cengage Learning.</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to check out student resources the publisher provides on the Internet. Lecture slides will be posted on the course website. Additional handouts will be distributed when needed to supplement the textbook.</p>

<h2 id="statistical-software-and-data">Statistical Software and Data</h2>

<p>Since the course is intended to give students hands-on experiences of data analysis, it is very important for students to learn and get familiar with statistical software. The main software program for the course is R and Python.</p>
