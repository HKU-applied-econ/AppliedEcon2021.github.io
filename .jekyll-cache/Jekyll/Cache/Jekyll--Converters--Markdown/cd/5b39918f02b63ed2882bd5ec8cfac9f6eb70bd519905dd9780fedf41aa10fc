<h4 id="so-how-would-i-define-causal-inference">So how would I define causal inference?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we’ve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
  <li>It’s sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on “program evaluation” in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments.</li>

<h4 id="correlation-with-causality">Correlation with causality</h4>

<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say “correlation does not mean causality.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn’t cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer’s cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</li>
  <li>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a central bank reading tea leaves to discern when a recessionary wave is forming.</li>
      <li>Seeing evidence that a recession is emerging, the bank enters into open-market operations, buying bonds and pumping liquidity into the economy.</li>
      <li>These actions are done optimally, these open-market operations will show no relationship whatsoever with actual output.</li>
      <li>In fact, in the ideal, banks may engage in aggressive trading in order to stop a recession, and we would be unable to see any evidence that it was working <em>even though it was</em>!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
