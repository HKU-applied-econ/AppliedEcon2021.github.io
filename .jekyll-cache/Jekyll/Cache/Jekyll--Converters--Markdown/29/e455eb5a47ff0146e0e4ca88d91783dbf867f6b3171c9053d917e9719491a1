<p>I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality. I had been orbiting that theory ever since seeing that difference-in-differences table in Levine (2004). But I needed more. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new‚ÄîI developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn‚Äôt know.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-would-i-define-causal-inference">So how would I define causal inference?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we‚Äôve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
</ul>

<p>But however you date its emergence, causal inference has now matured into a distinct field, and not surprisingly, you‚Äôre starting to see more and more treatments of it as such. It‚Äôs sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on ‚Äúprogram evaluation‚Äù in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments. To name just a few textbooks in the growing area, there‚Äôs Angrist and Pischke (2009), Morgan and Winship (2014), Imbens and Rubin (2015), and probably a half dozen others, not to mention numerous, lengthy treatments of specific strategies, such as those found in Angrist and Krueger (2001) and Imbens and Lemieux (2008). The market is quietly adding books and articles about identifying causal effects with data all the time.</p>

<p>So why does Causal Inference: The Mixtape exist? Well, to put it bluntly, a readable introductory book with programming examples, data, and detailed exposition didn‚Äôt exist until this one. My book is an effort to fill that hole, because I believe what researchers really need is a guide that takes them from knowing almost nothing about causal inference to a place of competency. Competency in the sense that they are conversant and literate about what designs can and cannot do. Competency in the sense that they can take data, write code and, using theoretical and contextual knowledge, implement a reasonable design in one of their own projects. If this book helps someone do that, then this book will have had value, and that is all I can and should hope for.</p>

<p>But what books out there do I like? Which ones have inspired this book? And why don‚Äôt I just keep using them? For my classes, I mainly relied on Morgan and Winship (2014), Angrist and Pischke (2009), as well as a library of theoretical and empirical articles. These books are in my opinion definitive classics. But they didn‚Äôt satisfy my needs, and as a result, I was constantly jumping between material. Other books were awesome but not quite right for me either. Imbens and Rubin (2015) cover the potential outcomes model, experimental design, and matching and instrumental variables, but not directed acyclic graphical models (DAGs), regression discontinuity, panel data, or synthetic control. Morgan and Winship (2014) cover DAGs, the potential outcomes model, and instrumental variables, but have too light a touch on regression discontinuity and panel data for my tastes. They also don‚Äôt cover synthetic control, which has been called the most important innovation in causal inference of the last 15 years by Athey and Imbens (2017a). Angrist and Pischke (2009) is very close to what I need but does not include anything on synthetic control or on the graphical models that I find so critically useful. But maybe most importantly, Imbens and Rubin (2015), Angrist and Pischke (2009), and Morgan and Winship (2014) do not provide any practical programming guidance, and I believe it is in replication and coding that we gain knowledge in these areas.4</p>

<p>This book was written with a few different people in mind. It was written first and foremost for practitioners, which is why it includes easy-to-download data sets and programs. It‚Äôs why I have made several efforts to review papers as well as replicate the models as much as possible. I want readers to understand this field, but as important, I want them to feel empowered so that they can use these tools to answer their own research questions.</p>

<p>Another person I have in mind is the experienced social scientist who wants to retool. Maybe these are people with more of a theoretical bent or background, or maybe they‚Äôre people who simply have some holes in their human capital. This book, I hope, can help guide them through the modern theories of causality so common in the social sciences, as well as provide a calculus in directed acyclic graphical models that can help connect their knowledge of theory with estimation. The DAGs in particular are valuable for this group, I think.</p>

<p>A third group that I‚Äôm focusing on is the nonacademic person in industry, media, think tanks, and the like. Increasingly, knowledge about causal inference is expected throughout the professional world. It is no longer simply something that academics sit around and debate. It is crucial knowledge for making business decisions as well as for interpreting policy.</p>

<p>Finally, this book is written for people very early in their careers, be they undergraduates, graduate students, or newly minted PhDs. My hope is that this book can give them a jump start so that they don‚Äôt have to meander, like many of us did, through a somewhat labyrinthine path to these methods.</p>
