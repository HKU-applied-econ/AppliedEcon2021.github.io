<p>I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality. I had been orbiting that theory ever since seeing that difference-in-differences table in Levine (2004). But I needed more. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new‚ÄîI developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn‚Äôt know.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-would-i-define-causal-inference">So how would I define causal inference?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Causal inference is the leveraging of theory and deep knowledge of institutional details to estimate the impact of events and choices on a given outcome of interest.</li>
  <li>It is not a new field; humans have been obsessing over causality since antiquity. But what is new is the progress we believe we‚Äôve made in estimating causal effects both inside and outside the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Some date the beginning of this new, modern causal inference to Fisher (1935), Haavelmo (1943), or Rubin (1974). Some connect it to the work of early pioneers like John Snow.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs sometimes reviewed in a lengthy chapter on ‚Äúprogram evaluation‚Äù in econometrics textbooks (Wooldridge 2010), or even given entire book-length treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="correlation-with-causality">Correlation with causality</h3>

<p>It is very common these days to hear someone say ‚Äúcorrelation does not mean causality.‚Äù</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the rooster crows, the sun soon after rises, but we know the rooster didn‚Äôt cause the sun to rise. Had the rooster been eaten by the farmer‚Äôs cat, the sun still would have risen. Yet so often people make this kind of mistake when naively interpreting simple correlations.</li>
  <li>But weirdly enough, sometimes there are causal relationships between two things and yet <em>no observable correlation</em>. Now that is definitely strange. How can one thing cause another thing without any discernible correlation between the two things? Consider this example, which is illustrated in Figure <a href="https://mixtape.scunning.com/introduction.html#fig:scottboat">1.1</a>. A sailor is sailing her boat across the lake on a windy day. As the wind blows, she counters by turning the rudder in such a way so as to exactly offset the force of the wind. Back and forth she moves the rudder, yet the boat follows a straight line across the lake. A kindhearted yet naive person with no knowledge of wind or boats might look at this woman and say, ‚ÄúSomeone get this sailor a new rudder! Hers is broken!‚Äù He thinks this because he cannot see any relationship between the movement of the rudder and the direction of the boat.</li>
